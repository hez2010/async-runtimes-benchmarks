# Rust Async Tasks Benchmark

## Performance Characteristics

### Why Rust?

- Zero-cost abstractions
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- High-performance async runtime (Tokio)

### Benchmark Methodology

- Spawn 100,000 concurrent tasks
- Each task sleeps for 10 seconds
- Track memory and execution metrics

## Performance Recommendations

1. Use latest stable Rust version
2. Enable LTO (Link Time Optimization)
3. Use release profile (`--release`)
4. Consider alternative allocators

### Execution

```bash
cargo run --release [num_tasks]
```
